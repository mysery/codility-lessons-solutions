 *
 * Consider an Uber-City where the only passenger vehicles on the roads are
 * self-driving Uber cars. Since all the cars are self-driving, you could
 * synchronize the car speeds in such a way that traffic lights would be
 * obsolete.
 *
 * As a first step you need to implement an algorithm that would check whether
 * removing traffic lights at a given intersection of two one-way roads will
 * lead to a car crash.
 *
 * For each road you know when a car will approach the crossroads. You also know
 * how long it takes to cross the crossroads.
 *
 * Example
 *
 * For road1 = [1, 5, 6, 7], road2 = [3, 10] and crossTime = 2, the output
 * should be crossroads(road1, road2, crossTime) = false.
 *
 * The cars will cross the crossroads in the following order without colliding:
 * road1[0], road2[0], road1[1], road1[2], road1[3], road2[2].
 *
 * For road1 = [2], road2 = [3] and crossTime = 2, the output should be
 * crossroads(road1, road2, crossTime) = true.
 *
 * The car on the first road will not make it when the car from the second road
 * appears since crossing the intersection takes 4 seconds.
 *
 * Input/Output
 *
 * [time limit] 3000ms (java)
 *
 * [input] array.integer road1
 *
 * A strictly increasing array of positive integers which define the times (in
 * seconds) when a new car approaches the crossroads by the first road.
 *
 * Constraints: 1 ≤ road1.length ≤ 10, 1 ≤ road1[i] ≤ 40.
 *
 * [input] array.integer road2
 *
 * A strictly increasing array of positive integers which define the times (in
 * seconds) when a new car approaches the crossroads by the second road.
 *
 * Constraints: 0 ≤ road2.length ≤ 10, 1 ≤ road2[i] ≤ 40.
 *
 * [input] integer crossTime
 *
 * The number of seconds it takes for a car to cross the crossroads.
 *
 * Constraints: 1 ≤ crossTime ≤ 10.
 *
 * [output] boolean
 *
 * true if removing the traffic lights will cause a collision, false otherwise.
